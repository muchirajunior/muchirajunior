## Hi there i'm muchira junior 👋

### I`m a Software Dev 

### MY STACK :: Flutter💙 Dart, React Js, ASP.NET C#, Python(Flask...) and others.

- 💙 In love with Flutter 
- 🎬 Always Watching some tech on YouTube
- 📚 I’m currently on .NET backed APIs but I'll try to come in terms with MAUI & Views someday
- 🍔 I have Experience PostgreSql, Mongo, Sqlite  and other databases. I think AWS RDS is great, Azure cosmos db is similar but easier to use and cost effective.
- 🕸️ I like S+CSS & Bootstrap and sometimes Tailwind fronted CSS, Bootstrap is first because I don't like long css classes and I love the idea of theming apps
- 🚀 I also used Firebase but now I love Supabase for Apps(Flutter,React ...) BAAS 
- ☁️ Azure cloud computing, Docker containerization and github workflows CI/CD. AWS rejected my credit card but am working on it.
